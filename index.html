            <h5>Jacob Weaver, November 22, 2020</h5>
            <p>Our town went through a golden age last year.Mostly everyone had a good running compeny and guess
                      why every one was happy because people never fought but
                      then we split up because the church was geting to big and thats when the roten age came everyone fought about the government 
                      and the next person to come the governor so are town decided a week ago to just not to have a governor. We will vote for 
                      governor but none of us will try to be come a governor. Just an update from our town and other towns shold give updates.

                    The moves will be shown in the newspaper once the games are over. The first prize winner will earn 30$,
