            <h2 class="title">The Man who paid no taxes</h2>
            <h5> Rachel Tillinghast, September 20,2020</h5>
            <p>Once there was a man who lived on the border of Arkansas and Missouri. Missouri thought he was paying tax to Arkansas & Arkansas thought 
                      he was paying tax to Missouri. By and by, the states found out he wasn't paying tax at all. They they found a law saying whichever state
                      his bed was on, that state he would pay tax to. One night they crept up and peeked in his window and they saw his bed was halfway across

            <h2 class="title">Government to launch website in less than 3 days!!</h2>
            <h5>Noah Tillinghst, September 2, 2020</h5>
            <p>The government will be launching a website within three days and perhaps even the next day. As development goes on smoothly they may launch the 
                      website within a day. Vice-Governor Noah Tillinghast says "We are pretty happy with the way the website is going. If the COR accepts the plan 
                      I have for taxes and government jobs than we might be able to have eVoting services in less than 3 months." The main thing that this would hang on 
                      would be the passing of the bill to give everyone a Verification/Bank number to access services on the internet without being duped by
                      someone impersonating another person. Among the potential difficulties to the program would be people not being able to access the internet.

            <h5>Anonymous, September 1 2020</h5>
            <p>Crown has lauched a website with an ecommerce portal attached. CEO Noah Tillinghast announced that Crown will be posting on their Job Finder a 
                      job for Weaverville to send messages up to Tillinghastville. The possibilities of this would be a way to send messages to Weaverville and have
                      them answered in a day.For more information check <a href="https://noahti.github.io/crown">here</a> to see the website.</p>

            <p>Every Since August 13th when I launched the website we have been trying to find a way for people to contact us. 
Now you can send us a message and have it directly delivered to me. Look at <a href="https://noahti.github.io/form">this</a> to send us a message. 
             the Government will soon be rolling out verification numbers and citizenship papers so that we can verify who is who from a message.</h2>-->

   <h2 class="title">Town Elections</h2>
    <h5>Noah Tillinghast, August 13, 2020</h5>
    <p>  Due to unforeseen complications Elisha Millioni has spent nearly 9 months in office, since it was just decided to have 
              the election this weekend instead of leaving it for a later time we do not know know who will be running for election;
              if you are running for election contact the COR in their meeting. The COR will decide whether or not Elisha will be running 
              for a second term because he has served for 3, but was only elected for one term.      </p>
    <h2 class="title">Taxes</h2>
    <h5>Noah Tillinghast, August 13, 2020</h5>
    
    <p>  The central government, due to the calculations of Noah Tillinghast will need at least 2500$ a year to keep all its functions. 
              This gigantic sum will be  raised through capitation taxes, income taxes, and printing money. If you have your own idea on 
              what taxes should look like than contact your COR representative with the plan.   </p>-->
